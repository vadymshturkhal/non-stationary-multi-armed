# Nonstationary Multi-Armed Bandit Reinforcement Learning Project
This project is an exploration into applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to the domain of slot machines, using PyTorch for model development and training. Our goal is to develop agents that can learn optimal strategies for playing slot machine games to maximize rewards over time.

# Technologies Used
- Pygame
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Psycopg2

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy matplotlib psycopg2
```
